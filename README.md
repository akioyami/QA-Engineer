## 🛠️ What’s Inside (GitHub Wiki Navigation)
I have structured this portfolio to mirror a real-world QA workflow. Click the links below to explore specific technical artifacts:

### 📑 [Test Documentation & Strategy](link-to-wiki-page)
* [cite_start]**Real-World Scenarios:** Detailed test cases and checklists for open-source and live web applications[cite: 9, 15].
* [cite_start]**Defect Management:** Examples of high-quality bug reports featuring logs, environment details, and clear reproduction steps[cite: 15].
* **Traceability:** Demonstrating how I map requirements to test coverage.

### 🔌 [API & Backend Validation](link-to-wiki-page)
* [cite_start]**Postman Collections:** Practical execution of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Integrity Checks:** Validation of JSON schemas, status codes, and data consistency across client-server interactions[cite: 16, 17].

### 🗄️ [Database & Log Analysis](link-to-wiki-page)
* [cite_start]**SQL Mastery:** Scripts I use for backend validation and data integrity testing between the UI and MySQL databases[cite: 11, 17].
* [cite_start]**Root Cause Analysis:** Real examples of using **Elastic Stack (Kibana)** and **Chrome DevTools** to pinpoint failures in system logs[cite: 11, 17].

### 📦 [Infrastructure & Environment](link-to-wiki-page)
* [cite_start]**Docker:** Using containers to isolate testing environments[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Version Control:** My workflow for managing test assets using Git/GitHub[cite: 11].

## 📈 Testing Philosophy
* [cite_start]**User-Centric:** Focusing on core user flows and edge cases that impact business revenue[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Evidence-Based:** Every bug report is backed by logs, network traces, and visual evidence[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Continuous Improvement:** My background in programming helps me speak the same language as developers, speeding up the debugging process[cite: 27].

I don't just find bugs; I identify root causes. [cite_start]My experience on crowdtesting platforms (uTest, Testlio) taught me to work under tight deadlines and deliver high-quality reports that developers can act on immediately[cite: 13, 14, 15].
