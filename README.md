## 🛠️ What’s Inside (GitHub Wiki Navigation)
I have structured this portfolio to mirror a real-world QA workflow. Click the links below to explore specific technical artifacts in the **Wiki** section:

### 📑 [Test Documentation & Strategy](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/wiki/Test-Documentation)
* **Real-World Scenarios:** Detailed test cases and checklists for live web and mobile applications.
* **Defect Management:** Examples of high-quality bug reports featuring logs, environment details, and clear reproduction steps.
* **Traceability:** Demonstrating how I map requirements to test coverage.

### 🔌 [API & Backend Validation](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/wiki/API-Testing)
* **Postman Collections:** Practical execution of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
* **Integrity Checks:** Validation of JSON schemas, status codes, and data consistency across client-server interactions.

### 🗄️ [Database & Log Analysis](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/wiki/SQL-and-Logs)
* **SQL Mastery:** Scripts used for backend validation and data integrity testing between the UI and MySQL databases.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Real examples of using **Elastic Stack (Kibana)** and **Chrome DevTools** to pinpoint failures in system logs.

## 📈 Testing Philosophy
* **User-Centric:** Focusing on core user flows and edge cases that impact business revenue.
* **Evidence-Based:** Every bug report is backed by logs, network traces, and visual evidence (using Charles Proxy and DevTools).
* **Continuous Improvement:** My background in programming helps me understand application logic and developer workflows, speeding up the debugging process.
